# Smart-Transactions
Fully realized ACCP-based (Atomicity, Consistency, Concurrency, Permanency) online transactions would allow, first, to connect and manage all associative input transactions to a single
output transaction, second, to eliminate any third party that is not a participant of transaction contract, third, to fully automate an
execution of multi-steps contracts with a possibility to track them on every step, fourth, to promptly identify and extract any transaction
data, and fifth, to dynamically scale a transaction network proportionally to the amount of its active participants.
We propose a mechanism that allow every single participant of the transaction network to dynamically manage any transaction on his or
her own economic way.

We define a smart transaction as a smart box that has its own predetermined work logic. The work logic determines two components:
input type and association policy between all possible inputs.
